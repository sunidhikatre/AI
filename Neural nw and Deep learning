A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (called neurons) that process data.

How it learns (in short):

Input data is passed through the network.

Each connection has a weight, and each neuron applies a function (usually a weighted sum + activation).

The network makes a prediction.

The prediction is compared to the actual result using a loss function (which measures the error).

The network adjusts its weights via a method called backpropagation, using gradient descent to minimize the error.

This repeats over many data examples (epochs) until the network learns the correct patterns.

In essence:
➡️ Predict → Compare → Adjust → Repeat.

Deep learning:
Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning where algorithms are structured in multiple layers of neural networks to automatically learn patterns from large amounts of data.

The term "deep" refers to the many hidden layers (not just 1 or 2) in the network. These deep layers enable the system to learn increasingly complex features — for example:

First layers might learn edges in an image.

Deeper layers might learn shapes, then faces, then identities.

Key features of Deep Learning:

No need for manual feature extraction — the network learns features on its own.

Requires large datasets and powerful hardware (like GPUs).

Uses techniques like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for images, RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) for sequences, and Transformers for language.
