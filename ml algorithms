Machine Learning Problem Types
üü¢ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Classification
What it is: Predicts a category/label from a set of predefined classes.

Output: Discrete values (Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam, Cat/Dog).

Examples:

Email spam detection

Disease prediction (Positive/Negative)

Sentiment analysis (Positive/Negative/Neutral)

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, XGBoost.

üü£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regression
What it is: Predicts a continuous numeric value.

Output: Real numbers (like price, temperature, or age).

Examples:

House price prediction

Stock market forecasting

Weather temperature prediction

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting.

üîµ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering
What it is: Groups similar data points together without predefined labels.

Output: Cluster IDs (like Cluster 1, Cluster 2‚Ä¶)

Examples:

Customer segmentation

Document grouping

Market basket analysis

Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

üü° 4Ô∏è‚É£ Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection)
What it is: Identifies rare or unusual data points that don‚Äôt conform to normal patterns.

Output: Normal or Anomaly

Examples:

Credit card fraud detection

Network intrusion detection

Fault detection in machines

Algorithms: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN (for density-based anomaly), Autoencoders (in Deep Learning)
