MLOps (short for Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices, tools, and processes designed to manage and automate the end-to-end lifecycle of Machine Learning models — from development and training to deployment, monitoring, and maintenance in production.

It’s essentially like DevOps for Machine Learning systems, ensuring models are reliable, scalable, reproducible, and continuously improved over time.
