An Artificial Neural Network is a machine learning model structured like a simplified brain — with layers of neurons that process data,
learn patterns, and make predictions by adjusting internal connections.


Prompt Engineering:
Prompt Engineering = smartly designing your input to guide the AI’s output in the direction you want.
Prompt Engineering is the smart, structured, and intentional way of designing that input so the AI gives you:

Better quality results

Relevant, clear, and accurate outputs

Responses in your desired format

It’s not about changing the model — it’s about changing how you ask.
