Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that focuses on developing systems that can learn from data, identify patterns,
and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Instead of hardcoding rules, ML systems use algorithms to process data, learn relationships or trends within it,
and improve their performance over time as they encounter more data.

Azure machine learning:
Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based platform from Microsoft that helps data scientists and developers build, train, deploy, 
and manage machine learning models quickly and efficiently. 
It simplifies the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle and integrates MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices for managing models in production.

Key Features:
Data Preparation → Clean, transform, and explore data

Model Training & Experimentation → Train models using AutoML, custom scripts, or notebooks

Model Deployment → Deploy models as APIs or containers (AKS, Azure Functions, or Edge)

Model Monitoring → Track model performance, drift, and health

MLOps Integration → Automate workflows, manage models, and enable CI/CD for ML

Supports multiple languages and frameworks → Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.
