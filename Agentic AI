ðŸ“Œ What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to AI systems that act as autonomous agents â€” meaning they can:

Make decisions

Pursue goals

Take actions in the world

Adapt their behavior based on feedback

These systems are designed to plan, reason, and act with a degree of independence, rather than just passively responding to prompts.

Itâ€™s different from traditional AI (like a chatbot answering your question) because Agentic AI proactively decides what to do next to achieve a given objective.
