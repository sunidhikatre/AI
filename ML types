Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, 
and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

üìå Types of Machine Learning
1Ô∏è‚É£ Supervised Learning
Definition: The model learns from labeled data (data with correct answers provided).

Goal: Predict output for new, unseen data.

Examples: Spam detection, house price prediction.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning
Definition: The model learns patterns from unlabeled data (no predefined answers).

Goal: Discover hidden patterns or groupings.

Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

Goal: Improve learning accuracy when labeled data is scarce.

Examples: Image classification with few labeled images.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning
Definition: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions.

Goal: Learn the best actions to maximize cumulative rewards.

Examples: Game playing bots, self-driving cars.

üéØ In short:
Supervised ‚Üí labeled data

Unsupervised ‚Üí unlabeled data

Semi-Supervised ‚Üí mix of labeled & unlabeled

Reinforcement ‚Üí learns via trial & reward
