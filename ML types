Absolutely — here’s a clear, short revision-style list of all major Machine Learning types with quick descriptions:

📌 Types of Machine Learning
1️⃣ Supervised Learning
Definition: The model learns from labeled data (data with correct answers provided).

Goal: Predict output for new, unseen data.

Examples: Spam detection, house price prediction.

2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
Definition: The model learns patterns from unlabeled data (no predefined answers).

Goal: Discover hidden patterns or groupings.

Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

Goal: Improve learning accuracy when labeled data is scarce.

Examples: Image classification with few labeled images.

4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
Definition: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions.

Goal: Learn the best actions to maximize cumulative rewards.

Examples: Game playing bots, self-driving cars.

🎯 In short:
Supervised → labeled data

Unsupervised → unlabeled data

Semi-Supervised → mix of labeled & unlabeled

Reinforcement → learns via trial & reward
