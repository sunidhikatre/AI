AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a broad field focused on making machines mimic human intelligence, like reasoning, decision-making, language understanding, and perception. ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and improve over time without explicit programming.

Apart from ML, AI includes:

Expert Systems (rule-based decision-making)

Search & Optimization algorithms

Planning systems (action sequences to achieve goals)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) (understanding human language)

Computer Vision (interpreting images/videos)

Fuzzy Logic (approximate reasoning)

Evolutionary Algorithms (optimization via simulated evolution)

Robotics (AI-powered physical systems)

In short: All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML. AI covers many other techniques beyond data-driven learning.
