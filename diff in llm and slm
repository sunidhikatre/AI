Difference Between SLM (Small Language Model) and LLM (Large Language Model)
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of foundational AI model trained on massive volumes of text data,
often containing billions to hundreds of billions of parameters. It’s capable of understanding and generating human-like text for a wide variety 
of complex tasks such as long-form content generation, question answering, coding assistance, translation, and reasoning. 
Because of their large size, LLMs typically require powerful cloud 
infrastructure and GPUs to run efficiently and are deployed through cloud APIs or enterprise servers.

On the other hand, a Small Language Model (SLM) is a compact, lightweight version of a language model, 
typically containing millions to a few billion parameters. It’s optimized for faster inference, lower memory consumption,
and running on limited-resource environments like mobile devices, browsers, or edge servers. While SLMs might not match the broad reasoning 
and language capabilities of LLMs, they are highly efficient for specific, narrow tasks such as text classification, summarization, simple chatbots,
voice assistants, and offline AI applications.
