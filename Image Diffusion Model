ðŸ“Œ What is GPT?
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
It is a type of Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning and transformer 
architecture to understand and generate human-like text.

ðŸ“– How GPT Works:
Generative â†’ It can generate new text, complete sentences, answer questions, write articles, and more.

Pre-trained â†’ Before being fine-tuned for specific tasks, itâ€™s trained on a huge amount of general text data 
(like books, articles, web content) to learn language patterns and context.

Transformer â†’ It uses the transformer neural network architecture, which is designed for efficiently handling 
sequence data (like text) by focusing attention on important words or phrases within the input.



ðŸ“Œ What is an Image Diffusion Model?
An image diffusion model is a type of generative AI model that creates new images by starting with random noise and gradually refining it into a clear, meaningful image through a step-by-step denoising process.

ðŸ“– How Does It Work?
Start with pure random noise (like static on a TV screen).

The model gradually removes the noise in multiple steps, guided by learned patterns from real images during training.

At each step, the image gets a bit clearer until it eventually resembles a realistic image matching the desired prompt or condition.

Think of it like developing a photo in a darkroom â€” starting from a hazy image and slowly bringing it into focus.
