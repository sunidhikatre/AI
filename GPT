"GPT" stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It's a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by OpenAI that is designed to understand and generate human-like text.

Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

Generative: It can create (generate) new contentâ€”like writing an essay, answering questions, translating languages, or even writing code.

Pre-trained: The model is trained on a large dataset (like books, websites, conversations) before it's fine-tuned for specific tasks or made available to users.

Transformer: This refers to the underlying neural network architecture that enables the model to process and understand language effectively. The Transformer architecture is a
major breakthrough in AI and natural language processing (NLP).
